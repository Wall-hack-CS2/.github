## Core Gameplay & Mechanics

- 🎯 **Tactical rounds & economy management:** Teams alternate between attacking and defending, buying weapons and equipment based on team economy — strategic purchasing and resource sharing matter.  
- 🔫 **Gunplay & recoil mastery:** Precise spray control, positioning, movement/peek mechanics, and accurate headshots define skilled play more than raw firepower.  
- 🧠 **Team coordination & communication:** Use grenades, smokes, flashes, callouts, trades — teamwork and tactics often decide outcomes over individual skill.  
- 🌐 **Competitive matchmaking & ranking:** Ranked modes with skill-based matchmaking, communication systems, and global leaderboard for competitive integrity.  
- 🗺️ **Iconic and modernized maps:** Updated versions of classic maps plus new environments — each with unique bombsites, chokepoints, and tactical routes.  
- 🛠️ **Utility mechanics:** Realistic grenades, flashes, smoke cover, bomb plants/defuses — depth through tactical gadgets and map control.

## Game Modes & Features

- 💣 **Bomb-Defusal Mode:** Attacking team plants bomb; defending team tries to defuse or eliminate enemies. Core competitive mode.

## What Makes CS2 Stand Out

- 🔄 **Classic gameplay rooted in skill and strategy** — gun control, tactical positioning, teamplay over casual shooting.  
- ⚙️ **Modern technical enhancements** — updated engine, better netcode, visuals, audio cues, performance optimizations.  
- 🔥 **High competitive integrity** — balanced weapon mechanics, strict economy, tactical depth.  
- 🌍 **Large active community & mod support** — custom maps, community servers, mods, longevity.  
- 🏆 **High skill ceiling & replay value** — even after hundreds of hours, improvement and mastery remain rewarding.

## System & Performance Notes

- 🖥 **Scalable settings** allow smooth performance on a range of hardware — from budget PCs to high-end rigs.  
- 💡 **Optimized networking & hit registration** for fair, competitive matches.  
- 🏃‍♂️ **Movement and latency matter** — ping, optimization, and hardware quality influence competitive performance.  
- 🎯 **Map knowledge and sound design** — mastering audio cues (footsteps, reloads, smokes) dramatically improves decision-making.
